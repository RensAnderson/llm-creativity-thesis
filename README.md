This project performs evolutionary search to generate novel recipes and evaluates their creativity using large language models (LLMs) based on the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT). Recipes are evolved over multiple "islands" and generations, then assessed across four creativity dimensions: fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality.
