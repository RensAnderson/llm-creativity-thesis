This project investigates how various model features impact creative outcomes in recipe generation. Specifically, the research explores the influence of different FunSearch iterations, generator temperature settings, and evaluator models based on size. Rather than performing an evolutionary search, the study focuses on how these features affect the creativity of the generated recipes. The creativity of the recipes is evaluated using the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) framework, which assesses creativity across four dimensions: fluency, flexibility, elaboration, and originality. Recipes are generated and evaluated iteratively across multiple model configurations to examine how variations in the number of iterations, temperature settings, and evaluator model size influence the creative output.
